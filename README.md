PL-LOG introduces a set of APIs which enable PL/SQL code instrumentation with log messages of different levels (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, ERROR etc.), custom business error raising and unexpected Oracle error handling. 
  
Log and error messages can be codified, translated into different languages, stored in arbitrary location and later resolved by pluggable __resolvers__. Both codified and free-text messages may act as template strings with argument placeholders, which are later replaced with actual values using pluggable __formatters__.

All formatted messages are finally directed to (also pluggable) __handlers__ which store or forward them according to the user and developer needs. Each handler can be configured to process messages in a different language - this can be useful, for example, in a multi-language user environment to store all log entries only in english, but to display messages to the users in their preferred language.

PL-LOG can be configured with unlimited number or message resolvers/formatters/handlers, limiting flow of the messages by specifying numeric log levels. Log level of messages being handled can be manipulated irrespective of database transactions on the __system__, __session__ (even different from the current one!) and __handler__ level which allows developers to leave even the finest level logger calls (DEBUG and lower) in the code and quickly enable message output when necessary.

Additional useful features include __call stack tracking__ with subprogram __argument and variable value logging__, ORA- error __tranlating__ and __mapping__ to custom business errors upon reraise, custom language code handling.

PL-LOG is based on the [UTL_CALL_STACK](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/u_call_stack.htm#ARPLS74078]) package and therefore is only available on Oracle 12c R1 and up. Oracle abstract [object types](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADOBJ/adobjint.htm#ADOBJ00101) are used to implement extensible plugin API, so getting familiar with the OOP concepts is advisable before using the framework.
